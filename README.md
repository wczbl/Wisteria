# Wisteria
Wisteria is a simple 2D top down RTS game where you play as a hero. Throughout the game, you fight your way through hordes of enemies. This game is in very stages and I am not sure as of what the story will be, but keep in mind that this game will be updated from time to time. I started working on this game approxmimately 3 years ago and the game's graphics is heavily inspired by Minicraft(Minitale). Although the game uses a similar rendering technique, there are still thigs that differ, for example, the fog map.
