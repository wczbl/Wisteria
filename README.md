# Wisteria
Wisteria is a simple 2D top down RTS game where you play as a hero. Throughout the game, you fight your way through hordes of enemies. This game has made decent progress and I am not sure as of what the story will be, but keep in mind that this game will be updated from time to time. I started working on this game approxmimately 3 years ago, though, I only recently managed to find it when it was barely considered a game(that's how early it was). The game's graphics are heavily inspired by Minicraft(Minitale). The game uses a similar color palette rendering technique but there are still many thigns that differ, for example, the gameplay itself, the dialogue system and the fog map.
